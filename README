This is my implementation of an algorithmic url shortener for github pages...

This overloads your 404.html page.  I understand this might be frowned upon :)

Goals: 
  I wanted to be able to hand out sexy short links, while hosting my pages for free on github.
  Maintain 404 functionality if shortening fails.
  Not write more than 10 lines of code.
  
Just put the 404.html file on your github page's directory.

Algorithmic part will be built out as I clean up my site, but feel free to change and suit to your needs. 

Free for any and all use.  Fork, go to town, whatever.  Attribution is nice, not necessary.

Known Issues:
  --Crawlers/Meta Tag support (some people have redirect disabled... this sucks for them, Crawler's & JS)
  --Would be nice to algorithmically setup a 301 Redirect.

Possible Additions:
  --Add a form that'll compress a URL for you.  Then you can tweet about it.
  --Include a clickable link for people w/ redirect disabled.
